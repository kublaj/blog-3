# Privacy policy

<div class="alert alert-success">
This privacy policy is valid for the Opsbears Blog hosted on blog.opsbears.com only.
</div>

## Short version

- We store server access logs (IP address, time of access, browser and website accessed) for auditing and security 
purposes up to 90 days.
- Unless opted out, we collect and analyse comprehensive visitor data in an anonimized fashion using a web analytics 
software.

## Server access logs

When you visit this site, each request will cause a log entry to be created. This log entry lists the IP address, 
time of request, the resource requested and the user agent string sent by your browser. These logs are stored for up 
to 90 days on our servers for server management and security audit purposes.

The data represented in these logs is not enough to uniquely identify one visitor or end device. Furthermore perform 
no analysis of the data to do limited identification for an individual internet endpoint unless warranted to do so for 
security purposes.

## Analytics data

We gather visitor data using the analytics software Piwik, which is hosted on our servers. This data gathering is 
only done, all of the following conditions are met:

- Your browser is not configured to send a Do Not Track header.
- You have not opted out from analytics cookies on our [Cookie Policy page](/cookies) or the cookie consent bar.
- Your browser supports JavaScript and accepts third party cookies.
- You did not block the track.opsbears.com domain.

The data we gather is anonymized before storage, the last two parts of the IP address are made unreadable. This data is 
only kept for as long as it is necessary to create an aggregated data set and is purged afterwards. The raw, 
unprocessed data is kept for 30 days at most.

This data is only collected for website management purposes. The raw data will never be handed over to third parties,
the aggregated reports (containing no personally identifiable data) may be.

## Data storage

All data is stored on servers rented from [Zylon Internet](http://www.zylon.nl) that are exclusively managed by 
Opsbears.
