## Strictly Necessary Cookies

When opting to keep using behavior cookies or opting out of them, your preference is stored in a cookie on your 
computer for 30 days so we don't have to display the alert box about the cookie usage every time. This cookie contains 
the following data:

- If you have seen the alert box
- If you consented to using behavior cookies.

This cookie will not be set, if you have set the *Do Not Track* functionality in your browser.

**Please note:** If you use a filter list (such as prebake) to block our cookie alert, but do not disable cookies via
any of the means described below, you will automatically opt in to use cookies!

## Behavior Cookies

Unless you explicitly opt out, we will use [Piwik](http://piwik.org/) to better understand what our visitors need and
what they are looking for. **Piwik is hosted on our own servers**, data is never transmitted to third parties. When 
storing data about you, your IP address is stored in an anonymized manner (the last part is obfuscated).

You can disable these cookies for 30 days using the popup window on the top of the screen. You can also use the <em>Do
Not Track</em> setting in your browser to disable these cookies permanently. You can also disable JavaScript or block
the `track.opsbears.com` domain to disable tracking.

## FAQ

**Why can I only disable tracking cookies for 30 days?**

Your setting not to opt in for tracking cookies can only be stored in your browser &ndash; using cookies. As funny as
it is, we have no other method of doing that. [EU law](http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm) 
&ndash; as far as we understand it &ndash; does not allow us to store cookies for a long period of time on your 
computer, therefore we limited all cookies on our site to 30 days.

If you want to block us (and other compliant sites) from re-enabling tracking cookies after 30 days, you can always 
set your browser to send us a [*Do Not Track*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) function in your browser 
header, in which case we will not attempt to track you and we will not show you our cookie warning alert. You can 
alternatively block cookies or JavaScript on this site to disable tracking.

**Do you send data about me to third parties?**

Generally: no. If we are required to do so (such as for police investigations, etc.) we might, but the data we gather
is extremely limited in both time and amount. We don't want to sell to you, we don't care who you are (unless you 
want us to know), we just want to make sure there are no navigational problems and such on our site.

**Can I disable cookies / JavaScript and still use the site?**

Yes you can! Our site has full support for browsers that do not support / do not wish to support technologies such as
cookies and JavaScript. It's a blog after all, and you can read it with whatever browser you like!
